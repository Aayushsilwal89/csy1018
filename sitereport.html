          		<p>It was a lot of fun to learn how to make websites. We began by understanding the fundamentals of HTML before introducing tags. then after that, we switched to Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, which merely adds design colors and other interesting features to the page. I began with the index page, which kept things straightforward, and I worked hard to make a responsive navigation bar. Layout design for each page was also a challenge, but with effort and research, I improved my layout design and css skills. I gained a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of utilizing HTML and CSS to build a website throughout the course of this semester. The learning process for this subject was incredibly enjoyable and fascinating.Although creating the navigation bar was initially incredibly challenging, I made progress and produced a useful navigation bar over time. I also sought assistance from my tutors and YouTube. The website designs are straightforward. The website's background color is just a linear gradient to some extent. To increase the responsiveness of the website, I employed grids and flex display. After finishing the website, I also ran my programs through a validation checker to fix any incorrect building techniques. Stockphoto.com was used to get the images for the portfolio sections. Additionally, I created 3 responsive boxes for the blog page. To save all of my CSS scripts, I created the style.css file in a single page that was afterwards connected with every page I needed to design.</p>
